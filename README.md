# RustShell

This is an implementation of a shell in Rust--mostly just as a way for me to get used to the language. 

Current Structure:
All it does currently is echo back whatever the inputs are and then exits when quit is entered.

TODOS:
- Make commandmanager use a hashmap that mapped strings to functions with generic types.
- Streamline function registering.
- Register directory navigation functionality
- Set up program execution within the shell
